## First Run & Terms Acceptance

On first execution, you'll see our Terms of Service. Here's why:

### The Context:

- **Viral Growth**: 2,000+ clones in 13 days
- **Enterprise Scale**: Parquet enables professional-grade usage  
- **Responsibility**: With scale comes need for governance

### This Ensures:

- The project remains available for legitimate uses
- Everyone respects data provider terms
- Educational/research access continues uninterrupted

This is standard practice for successful data tools. The terms
protect you, us, and ensure the tool's long-term sustainability.
