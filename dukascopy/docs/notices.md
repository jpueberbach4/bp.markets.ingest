## **Notice: Endpoint down

Update: Hi, as of this morning (2025-01-17) the public historical feed seems to be down. It gives a 503 error. It is not IP-based, since all my "other IPs" experience the same behavior. Even IPs I didnt use yet for anything so far. Also my two mobiles fail. 503 normally indicates a resource issue. So it may be broken. Looking at the clones, likely, this project may have caused it. 

Tbh i was afraid that this would happen. This is why i asked to PLEASE keep the rate of requests reasonable and also to try out their platform. They have a great platform, with good support. I will reach out to the data provider next week if it stays like this for a bit in order to get their official stance on this project. I will share the results of that conversation in this e-mail. Me, personally, I am willing to pay for this feed, if the price is right. The doors it opened up have been amazing so far. 

I was able to get 100 percent correctly aligned candles and the data was perfect. Much better than i received from alternate resources. Even the "cleaned" exports from alternate resources, couldnt match my own processed data.

So lets see what happens. For now, it seems to "just have broken". A real block should give a 403. Access denied.

Also, i have started to write up everything i have learned on this project. I think this knowledge should be open. If you are interested in the internals of this project, the why, the what and the how, make sure to checkout [this documentation](performance.md) on a regular basis.

I will keep you posted.

**Note:** Development continues as planned. Data-api is now ready to make "buffered-charts". Updates soon.
