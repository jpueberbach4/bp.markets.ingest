**Status: bottom sniper**

I am currently developing an H4 bottom-sniper model using a 7–10 feature machine-learning setup.

The feature set includes, but is not limited to:

- Distance to a major D1 support zone, with confirmed historical buyer activity
- Higher-timeframe downtrend exhaustion (e.g. stair-stepping structure, flush-out candles)
- Volatility expansion 
- Distance to H4 liquidity, implemented in a manner similar to the support-distance feature
- Candle body size and wick structure
- Volume
- Price patterns
- Additional signals

The main challenges at the moment are technical, as most of the work involves translating discretionary chart “reading” into precise mathematical representations. What is visually intuitive for a human trader is significantly harder to encode in pure math.


Ofcourse there is the problem of overfitting. But... Let's see how far we get.

The system will get heavily tested as a feature engineering factory. Lets see how it holds up.
