## **Notice: User-agent has been blocked - 2026-01-16**

Today (2026-01-16), the user-agent used in download.py was blocked by the endpoint. The project has likely gained enough popularity to trigger alarms, resulting in a targeted user-agent block rather than an IP ban.

At its core, this project was evolving into a fully local, offline TradingView-like system—potentially encroaching on a multi-billion-dollar market segment due to the traction and attention it received. That said, development is continuing, and the planned C++ implementation will still be built.

This project serves as a showcase of how relatively easy it is to harvest, resample, enrich, and extend market data when access is available. Market data are facts and, in principle, should be accessible without artificial limits—especially for traders like us. This effort was an attempt at democratization.

I will be adding a performance.md file to document and explain the more interesting technical aspects of the implementation. The project achieved institutional-level performance on nothing more than a mid-range laptop.

So yes—there were limits to this “free data feed.”. I hoped the attribution and driving customers towards them would have prevented this shutdown. I didn't get any email.

Thank you all for the attention and interest in this project. It isn’t dead; it’s simply shifting direction.

Be sure to check back regularly for updates and further development progress.

Overall, I think the solution turned out extremely well.

Wishing you all a highly profitable 2026! 🚀

PS: it could be that users have been hammering this endpoint too much and automatic systems have triggered a temporary scraping ban. Sometimes requests are actually coming through.
