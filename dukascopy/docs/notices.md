MT4 is decoded. 

**The data part is now complete. Only documentation remains.**

## Notice

The repository at https://github.com/Shadowp2522/bp.markets.ingest is a clone with a weird 1.3 MB zipfile in there. The jpueberbach4 version is the official project, and I cannot vouch for the safety of the clone.

## Notice

Backfilling is not currently supported, as our pipeline processes data strictly forward. Because of this, historical data—particularly for illiquid pairs and at the highest granularity—may be skewed. Backfilling has been identified as a must-have feature.

We'll provide a script that should be executed once every seven days (run on saturdays). It will re-download the past week of data for all configured symbols and perform a full rebuild. This captures any backfills within that window, effectively addressing ~99.94-99.97% of all backfill issues.

For reference, running this on 26 symbols takes about five minutes (or around 2 minutes 30 seconds if you’re up to date and use the rebuild script)—a small price to pay for accuracy.

```python
Major FX         █░░░░░░░░░ 0.01%  (1 in 7,000-12,500 symbol-days)
Major Crosses    ███░░░░░░░ 0.05%
Illiquid FX      ██████████ 1.1%
Indices          ██░░░░░░░░ 0.09%
Major Crypto     ██████████ 1.3%
Altcoins         ████████████████ 3.5%
```

```sh
crontab -e
```
Add the following line, adjust path accordingly:

```sh
0 1 * * 6 cd /home/repos/bp.markets.ingest/dukascopy && ./rebuild-weekly.sh
```

This configuration triggers the rebuild script at 01:00 each Saturday. It will not conflict with the per-minute ./run.sh cron entry (due to locking). For additional assurance, you may choose to run it daily. Overall, the setup is now far more robust in terms of integrity.

>This is a universal challenge in market-data engineering. Even when working with top-tier, premium data vendors, the moment you download or extract data and begin using it, some portion of it may already be stale due to backfills. It’s an inherent property of financial datasets, not a limitation of this tool. There is no central log or official feed that reliably exposes all historical corrections, making automated detection non-trivial. As a result, every data pipeline—paid or free—must contend with this reality.

The quality of this dataset is on par with what you would receive from commercial providers. The difference is simply that this one is free.
