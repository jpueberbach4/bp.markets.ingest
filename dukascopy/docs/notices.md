<u>MT4 is decoded.</u>

What's next?

This moves to seperate (clean) repository by 31st of January.

I’ve merged the `clean-version` branch into `main`.

I’m currently building a powerful ML-driven bottom sniper. I’m still deciding whether to release it with this repository—features like this usually provide a real edge and are typically kept private. It’s an H4 bottom sniper; the H4 timeframe provides just enough data to train it effectively.
