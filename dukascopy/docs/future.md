## Notes and Future Work

>HTTP API for OHLC retrieval (0.6)

First version is implemented [see here](http.md)

>Replay functionality (0.7)

Documentation writeup has started [see here](../replay/placeholder.md)

>Cascaded indicator engine (1.0)

This likely won't be needed if we support a live.sh script that emulates behavior replay.sh

>MSSIB

Will not necessarily be ONLY a DuckDB extension. Vision has changed.

>C++ advanced concepts for trading (study)
