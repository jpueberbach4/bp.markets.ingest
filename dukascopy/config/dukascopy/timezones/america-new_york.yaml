# Asset Timezone Shift Configuration
#
# This file defines how market data for different trading symbols should be
# resampled and time-shifted based on the source timezone and its UTC offset.
#
# Each top-level key represents a timezone (e.g. Etc/UTC, America/New_York).
#
# For each timezone:
#   - offset_to_shift_map maps the detected UTC offset (in minutes) to a
#     timestamp shift (in milliseconds). This is mainly used to align data
#     to MT4 server time, which switches between GMT+2 and GMT+3 due to DST.
#   - symbols lists all instruments that should use this timezone/shift logic.
#
# The shift is applied dynamically based on the current UTC offset of the
# timezone (including daylight saving time changes).
#
# A wildcard symbol ('*') can be used as a catch-all for any instruments not
# explicitly listed.
#
# Example:
#   America/New_York
#     UTC-4 (DST)  -> shift to GMT+3
#     UTC-5 (STD)  -> shift to GMT+2
#
# This configuration ensures consistent candle alignment and correct
# historical resampling across assets, timeframes, and DST transitions.
#
# Timezones are traversed in the order specified below
# Use the wildcard '*' only on the last timezone entry
#
Etc/UTC:                          # This is an example on how to resample assets using UTC
  offset_to_shift_map:            # Defines a map to shift based on offset minutes
    0: 0                          # No shift. Incoming data is already UTC. Warning: NO DASH!!
