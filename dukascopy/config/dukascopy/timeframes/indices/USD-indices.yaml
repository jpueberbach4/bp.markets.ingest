# Instrument-Specific Timeframe Resampling Configuration
#
# This section defines custom resampling rules for individual instruments.
# It overrides or extends the default resampling behavior by specifying how
# higher timeframes (e.g. 4H) are constructed from lower source timeframes
# (e.g. 1H) on a per-symbol basis.
#
# For each instrument:
#   - timeframes lists the target timeframes to generate.
#   - rule defines the resampling interval (pandas-style, e.g. "4H").
#   - source specifies the base timeframe used for aggregation.
#   - origin sets the alignment anchor (exchange/session-specific start time).
#   - label and closed control candle labeling and boundary inclusion.
#
# This is primarily used for instruments with non-standard session starts
# (e.g. bonds), ensuring correct candle alignment and consistent historical
# aggregation.
#
# Please note that the ORIGIN field is set to the candle alignment as if it were winter in Europe.
