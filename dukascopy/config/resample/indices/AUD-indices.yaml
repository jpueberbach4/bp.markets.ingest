AUS.IDX-AUD:             # 2025-12-14: **NOT-OK**
  # The Aussie index requires additional software work. The MT candles are aligned with session breaks, 
  # which must be accounted for. Support for session breaks was already a planned feature (as some forex 
  # instruments also have breaks). One possible approach is to introduce an additional window rule—for 
  # example, allowing an hourly candle to use conditional timestamp logic. This could specify that from 
  # time A to time B one origin rule applies, and from time C to time D a different origin rule applies.
  # 
  # Until this is implemented, the Aussie index is currently unusable.
  #
  # Implementation details:
  #   if conditional logic specified: 
  #     filter: df.between_time(time-A, time-B) -> resample with origin A
  #     filter: df.between_time(time-C, time-D) -> resample with origin B
  #     two-phase resample
  # When? Soon. Performance impact limited (need to test)
