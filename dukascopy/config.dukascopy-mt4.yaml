# Dukascopy MT4 Data Pipeline Configuration
#
# This configuration file controls the behavior of the Dukascopy MT4 data processing suite,
# including downloading, transforming, aggregating, and resampling historical and live market data.
#
# Sections:
# 1. aggregate: Controls input/output paths for aggregation.
# 2. download: Retry/backoff settings, timeouts, rate limits, and paths for historical/live downloads.
# 3. transform: Time-shifting, rounding, input/output paths, and preparation for aggregation/resampling.
# 4. resample: Batch size, rounding precision, multi-timeframe resampling rules, and per-symbol overrides.
#
# Purpose:
# - Automate crash-resilient ETL pipelines for financial market data.
# - Support incremental updates with strict time-bin alignment across multiple timeframes.
# - Allow flexibility for various asset classes (forex, commodities, indices, crypto, bonds).
#
# Usage:
# - Imported by ETL scripts to configure paths, timeframes, rate limits, and resampling rules.
# - Customization per instrument or timeframe via the `symbols` section.
#
# Note:
# - Under development; features/settings may change.
# - Paths are relative to project root unless specified otherwise.

# Below you will find the configuration for the aggregate.py script.
